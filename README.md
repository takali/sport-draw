# Description #

Small tool for sport competition draw. Need a json with all the data (team, flag...). Then you got an admin to drag and drop team in a group, and a front site with team moving on live (by using socket)

# Launch #

* npm install
* npm start
* Back : localhost:3000/admin/interface/football/wc2018
* Front : localhost:3000/front/tos/football/wc2018

# TODO #
Lot of things to improve this tools :

* Some design
* Responsive
* Keep the team already moved if you refresh the Back/front
* Reset a move
* Administration of sport and competition
